# NekoNode API

NekoNode API is a RESTful API that provides anime data to the NekoNode CLI tool. It is built using Node.js and Express.js.

## NekoNode CLI

NekoNode CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to search for anime using the NekoNode API. You can find the NekoNode CLI repository [here](https://github.com/DeveloperJosh/anime-cli).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) I recommend using the latest LTS version.

## Documentation?

There is no documentation for the API as it is only used by the NekoNode CLI tool. If you want to use the API, you can check the source code.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the [NekoNode GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloperJosh/anime-cli/issues) make sure it has the `bug` Label.
